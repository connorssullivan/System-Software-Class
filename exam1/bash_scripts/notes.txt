- What are shell scripts
    Shell screpis are executable files made up of 1 or more simple yet powerfull commands. What makes them powerfull is that they con 
    execute many commands in the same files

- What is a Shell?
    A CLI Interface between the user and the linux syste, enabling the user to use commands to interact with the kernal

- What are 2 ways to interact with the linux shell?
    1: Interactivly: Typing commands in the CLI
    2: Shell Scripts: A script a user can execute whith a program

- Common Linus Commands
    date: display date
    cal: display calendar
    whoami: display user name
    pwd: display present working directory
    cd: change directory
    echo:: display string on screen
    man: display manual of the command
    ls: display file or directory name

- What is a Pipe? 
    A symbol that passes the output from one command, as the input of another

    Ex:
        ls -l >list.txt: Pass the permissions of a file to a txt file
        sort list.txt > list.out: sort a text file and pass it to another file as an input


- Variables are accesed usidng the $ opeerator, and when initalized cannot have whitespace
    Ex: 
        x=5
        echo "x is $x"
- read can be used to read input from CLI, and read only can be used for a constant Variables
    Ex: 
        read x
        echo $x
        readonly y
        echo $y

- Gravestone Operators `` will not do string interpalation, and \ followed by variable will not print the variable

- -n willpeint no new line after cho

- Enviormental Variables, are variables initalized in the enviorment, and can be used to control the variables of shell scripts, Normally they are all upercase
    $HOME: The home directory of the current user.
    $PATH: A colon-separated list of directories to search for commands. E.g./bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin
    $0: The name of the shell script.
    $#: The number of arguments passed.
    $n: nth argument that is to store nth argument passed in command line inorder.
    $*: Display all the argument values.
    $@: Same as $* if you do not put them in quotes. Otherwise, $@ will passyour arguments as separate strings, whereas $* will just pass allparams as a single argument. In general, $@ gives the better behavior.
    $?: Display exit status of statement. 0 means success; non-zerootherwise. It can also be used to hold return value for functions.
    $$: The process ID of the shell script. E.g. echo $$


- If statments can be used as so 
    if [ conditional statment ]; then
        block of code
    elif [ conditional statment ]; then
        block of code 
    else
        block of code 
    fi

- Some basic string comparison
    [ $string1 = $string2 ];then: Returns true if 2 strings are equal
    [ $string1 != $string2 ];then: Returns true if 2 strings are not equal
    [ -n file_path ]; then: Returns true if a file is not null

- Some Basic arithmitic operatiors:
    [ $num1 -eq $num2 ];then: Checks if 2 numbers are equal
    [ $num1 -ne $num2 ];then: Checks if 2 numbers are not equal
    [ $num1 -gt $num2 ];then: Rethurns True if num1 is bigger then num2
    [ $num1 -ge $num2 ];then: Returns True if num1 is greatur or equal to num2
    [ $num1 -lt $num2 ];then: Returns True if num1 is less then num 2
    [ $num1 -le $num2 ];then: Returns true if num1 is less or equal to num 2

- File Conditions: 
    -d file true if the file is a directory
    -e file true if the file has already been created
    -s file true if the file has nonzero size
    -f file true if the file is a regular file
    -r file, -w file, -x file true if the file is readable, writable, executable, respectively

- Logical Operators
    && = and
    || = or 
    ! = Nor
